This is a simple task manager.

- Click on the `New Task` Button to create a new task. When creating a new task, the new form validates whether the `Task Title` is empty or not.

- Click on `Delete` to delete a task.

- Click on `Toggle Completion` to toggle a task's completion state. A completed task has a `green` background color. A pending one has `white` background color.

- Click on `Show Completed` or `Show Pending` or `Show All` to view filtered tasks. `Show All` is selected by default.
